Sunbrella is coated with a fluorocarbon finish to make it water resistant, which makes it ideal for outdoor use. The water repellency of your carpet will need to be restored if it has been thoroughly cleaned or bleached. In order to restore this vital property, Sunbrella and other industry professionals suggest 303® Fabric GuardTM spray.

Water and stain resistant finishes are applied to Sunbrella textiles, which are intended to endure for many years but may need reapplication after a thorough cleaning procedure.</p><footer><a href=../../should-you-scotchgard-sunbrella-fabric-html.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../four-christmases-where-to-watch-movie.html>Where to watch Four Christmases</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
