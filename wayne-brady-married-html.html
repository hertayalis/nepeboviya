His first marriage was with Diana Lasso. The pair walked down the aisle on December 31, 1993.</p><p>Not much is known about Brady and Lasso's time together except for the fact that they ended their marriage on September 21, 1995.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Following the end of his first marriage, Brady remained single for the next few years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On April 3, 1999, the actor tied the knot with Mandie Taketa.

So much so, he gave much credit to his ex-wife when he was recovering from depression in 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">E! Online</a>, the television personality revealed he hit rock bottom during his 42nd birthday.

After hearing the news, Brady had taken to Twitter to mourn Williams' death.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>"Depression is real. God Bless Him and his family," He wrote. He also opened up about admiring Williams and how his life and death affected him when discussing his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">depression on Dr. Phil</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Thankfully, Brady could pull himself out of depression. And one person who he says helped him the most through his recovery phase was his ex-wife.</p><p>Brady showed his appreciation for Taketa, saying she was there for him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She was down with me when nobody in the world was down with me, except my mom. There was loyalty there, there was respect, there is trust–she is my baby mama.</p><p>On top of having his back, Taketa and Brady were also very&nbsp;committed to co-parenting their daughter.</p><p>To ensure that Maile could have as close to an experience as living in the same house, the two lived right next to each other as neighbors.</p><p>Brady has since&nbsp;used his platform to spread awareness about depression, hoping to help other people overcome it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK%2BRrrumecGrmJ2xXaKus77InptnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwayne-brady-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwayne-brady-married-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwayne-brady-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwayne-brady-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwayne-brady-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwayne-brady-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20020318123622.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20020318123622.html>LIZA MINNELLI TIES THE KNOT AT NEW YORK'S WEDDING OF THE YEAR</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./charlie-manuel-net-worth.html>Charlie Manuel Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./charlie-manuel-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
