<time>11 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik is Currently Where?</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>We gain a true understanding of Larry Ray as the predator he is thanks to Peacock’s “Sex, Lies, and the College Cult,” which delves into a story of control, extortion, sex trafficking, as well as violent attacks. After all, by his deft words and manipulations, he not only succeeded in brainwashing elite Sarah Lawrence College students into an abusive cult, but he also completely changed the course of many people’s lives. Among them was Bernard Kerik, a former commissioner of the New York Police Department who was also a part of his circle of friends; if you’re interested in learning more about him, we have the information you need.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.medadmbjmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bernard-Kerik-1-300x289.png></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Crossfire Actor Shalisha James Davis’s Biographical Information and Background</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bernard Kerik: Who is He?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Bernard, a former soldier who joined the NYPD in 1986, gained notoriety in the early 1990s as a result of his close relationship with politician Rudolph “Rudy” Giuliani. That’s because, before enlisting wholeheartedly in the Department of Correction in 1994, he proudly served as his bodyguard and driver during the winning 1993 mayoral election campaign. Only a year later did he meet Larry for the first time, and over the course of that time, their relationship grew to such depths that Larry ended up serving as best man in his 1998 nuptials to Hala Matli.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In fact, Bernard was named Commissioner of the Department of Corrections the same year of his marriage, a position he retained until he was named Commissioner of the New York Police Department in 2000. As a result, he was in charge during the terrifying September 11, 2001 attacks, to which his swift response gave him international notoriety and multiple awards in the US and the UK. Things soon started to alter, though, as Larry apparently became hell-bent on exacting revenge when his pal abandoned him when he was accused of (unrelated) securities fraud.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After Bernard dropped his bid to manage the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, Larry was purportedly the one who first make public his connections to the mob in the early 2000s. The ex-officer claimed that his decision to recruit an illegal alien as a nanny in the past was due to ignorance; however, further investigation revealed more. The ex-officer had left the force in 2001. It was discovered that he had made “misleading comments” to the White House during his interview for the position and had also accepted more than $250,000 from a supposedly mob-connected company for home improvements.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Bernard Bailey Kerik, an American consultant and former police officer, was the 40th Commissioner of the New York Police Department from 2000 to 2001. He was born on September 4, 1955. He received a presidential pardon in 2020 from President Donald Trump despite being a convicted felon with a long list of federal convictions for tax fraud, ethical violations, and criminal false statements.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In 1986, Kerik began working for the New York City Police Department (NYPD). His most well-known positions include those of New York City Police Commissioner from 2000 to 2001 and Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction from 1998 to 2000, both of which he held while overseeing the police response to the September 11 attacks. Kerik used a Battery Park City condominium that had been designated for first responders at ground zero to engage in two adulterous relationships at the same time.</p><p style=text-align:justify>George W. Bush appointed Kerik to serve as the interior minister of the Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority following the invasion of that country in 2003. Bush proposed Kerik as the nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security in 2004. Kerik quickly withdrew his application, nevertheless, citing the fact that he had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. His revelation sparked a federal and state inquiry. Kerik was sentenced to pay $221,000 in fines after entering a guilty plea in the Bronx Supreme Court in 2006 to two unconnected misdemeanour ethical breaches.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kerik admitted admission to eight federal felonies in 2009 in the Southern District of New York. He received a four-year prison term in federal prison in February 2010. President Donald Trump fully pardoned Kerik for the federal charges on February 18, 2020. After the 2020 US presidential election, Kerik backed Trump’s unfounded allegations of voting fraud and worked to have the results overturned.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Education of Bernard Kerik</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Donald Raymond Kerik Sr. and Patricia Joann (Bailey) Kerik’s son, Kerik, was born in Newark, New Jersey. He has an Irish American mother. His paternal grandpa changed his last name from Kapurik to Kerik after moving from Russia to a Pennsylvania coal mining community.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kerik grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, and was brought up as a Catholic. He was a Paterson resident who attended Eastside High School before leaving in 1972.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He joined the US Army in July 1974 and was stationed at Fort Bragg, NC, where he earned a General Educational Development (GED) credential from the State of North Carolina. He earned a B.S. in social theory, social structure, and change from Empire State College of the State University of New York in 2002 after leaving the New York City Police Department.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Margie Cooper Model Photos: Antiques Roadshow Host Was A Model & Her Career and Family</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career of Bernard Kerik</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Kerik joined the American Army and served in the Military Police, stationed in Korea, after quitting high school.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After leaving the Army, Kerik worked as a security consultant in the Middle East; the Saudi royal family was one of his early clients.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kerik speaking during a press briefing in 2001 about collecting crime scene evidence from the World Trade Center site</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kerik worked in the Passaic County Sheriff’s Office in New Jersey from December 1981 to October 1982, followed by July 1984 to July 1986. Before becoming head and warden of the Passaic County jail, he worked as the department’s training officer, commander of the special weapons, and special operations.</p><p style=text-align:justify>From 1982 until 1984, Kerik served as the security division’s chief of investigations at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. After a 1984 Saudi secret police investigation, six hospital security personnel—including Kerik—were sacked and deported. Kerik claimed in his autobiography that he was expelled as a result of a fight with a Saudi secret police interrogator.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, nine former hospital employees claimed to The Washington Post that Kerik worked with a hospital administrator to monitor people’s private affairs in 2004, following his nomination as Secretary of Homeland Security. This scandal was partially caused by Feteih’s use of “the institution’s security staff to track the private lives of several women with whom he was romantically involved, and men who came in contact with them.”</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bernard Kerik As A Police</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In 1986, Kerik began working for the New York City Police Department.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He first met Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1990 and worked as Giuliani’s driver and bodyguard during the 1993 campaign for mayor of New York City. He began working for the New York City Department of Corrections in 1994 and, because to Giuliani’s support, received a number of promotions.</p><p style=text-align:justify>On one instance, Kerik’s publisher, Judith Regan, accused several Fox News staffers of stealing a necklace and a mobile phone and sent homicide investigators to question and fingerprint those individuals.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He made five arrests while serving as police commissioner, including one involving two ex-offenders who were allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem. One of the suspects was a paroled murderer who was wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia.</p><p style=text-align:justify>During the September 11 attacks, Kerik was the police commissioner.</p><p style=text-align:justify>When American Airlines Flight 11 collided with the North Tower, he was in his office. Three minutes before United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower, he arrived at the base of the North Tower, where he and his team were doused in rubble as Giuliani, Kerik, and their top aides were trapped within a structure at 75 Barclay Street. The September 11 attacks elevated Kerik’s profile on a national scale. At the end of Giuliani’s administration, on December 31, 2001, Kerik had served as commissioner for 16 months.</p><p style=text-align:justify>On June 6, 2020, Kerik said that “during the eight-year period that Giuliani was in office, we lowered the violent crime by 63 percent, dropped the murder (sic) by 70 (sic) overall in the city” in a joint interview with Giuliani with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Bernard Kerik Back to the Private Sector</h2><p style=text-align:justify>After leaving the New York City Police Department, he worked for Giuliani Partners, a consultancy company that Giuliani founded. He served as both the chief executive officer of Giuliani-Kerik LLC, a subsidiary of Giuliani Partners, and senior vice president of Giuliani Partners. These posts were held by Kerik till December 2004. He founded The Kerik Group LLC in March 2005 and served as its chairman until June 2009. The Kerik Group LLC offers consultancy services in crisis management and risk reduction, counterterrorism and law enforcement, and jail/prison administration techniques.</p><p style=text-align:justify>King Abdullah II of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and President Bharrat Jagdeo of the Republic of Guyana have both used him as an advisor and consultant.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He has worked on crime reduction and national security plans in Trinidad and Tobago as well as conducted threat and vulnerability assessments for a governing family in the United Arab Emirates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.medadmbjmc.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bernard-Kerik-290x300.png><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ross Smith’s Famous Grandma Gangster Granny Was Recently Diagnosed With Cancer</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What’s Become of Bernard Kerik?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In June 2006, Bernard pleaded guilty to two misdemeanour counts related to the alleged organised crime connection; nonetheless, he was spared jail time and just required to pay $221,000 in fines. Nevertheless, the high school dropout — he earned his GED while serving in the army — was given a 4 year federal prison sentence in 2010, along with 3 years of probation and a requirement to pay $188,000 in reparations. This came after he pleaded guilty to five counts of providing false statements to the government, two counts of tax fraud, and one count of fabricating information to obtain a loan.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Bernard allegedly was released from federal jail on October 15, 2013, and has been a free man ever since. His supervised release period ended permanently in October 2016. It’s important to note that on February 18, 2020, President Donald Trump completely pardoned him for his eight 2010 felony convictions, allowing him to further his career.</p><p style=text-align:justify>We should also point out that none of the other allegations Larry made against Bernard, particularly the one about bribing kids (Larry’s victims) to poison him, have ever been supported by any proof. Since he still lives in the New York City Metropolitan Area at the age of 67, the former police executive works as a public speaker, entrepreneur, consultant, and author. The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice (2001) and “From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate 84888-054” are the only two autobiographies the CEO of Kerik Group has written to date (2014).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWiZnqqelr%2BlecqeqaKjXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbernard-kerik.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbernard-kerik.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbernard-kerik.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbernard-kerik.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbernard-kerik.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbernard-kerik.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gary-moore-net-worth-146717.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gary-moore-net-worth-146717.html>Gary Moore Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emily-blunt-and-john-krasinskis-body-language-on-cca-red-carpet-decoded-after-fans-question-divorce.html>Emily Blunt and John Krasinski's body language on CCA red carpet decoded after fans question 'divorc</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emily-blunt-and-john-krasinskis-body-language-on-cca-red-carpet-decoded-after-fans-question-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
