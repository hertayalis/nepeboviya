But to whom has the LA-born star been married, and for how long? Join <strong>HELLO!</strong> as we look at all the details you need to know about each of Kim's past weddings…</p><h2><strong>How many times has Kim Kardashian got married?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9348fb62bc23-gettyimages-1206944642.jpg><p id=eAAE-UVKPXay data-wc=44>Kim Kardashian has so far been married three times. As well as her most recent <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>high-profile relationship</a></strong> with controversial rapper and public figure <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>, Kim has also been married to National Basketball Association player Kris Humphries and to the music producer Damon Thomas.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><h2><strong>Kim Kardashian and Damon Thomas' wedding</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b6b29f7eb0b1-kim-kardashian-damon-thomas-wedding.jpg><p id=eqWbvIPKQiHA data-wc=60>The Kardashians star married relatively private star Damon in Las Vegas in 2000, when she was 19 years old. The then 28-year-old and Kim had reportedly been dating for around two years prior to the wedding, but as neither star were huge household names at the time (in comparison to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kim's status today</a></strong>) little is known about their spontaneous elopement.</p><p id=ehyM3cEiVWer data-wc=66>In 2018, Kim claimed she was on ecstasy when the two got married in Vegas. "I did ecstasy once and I got married", the star said in a season 15 episode of her reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Damon later <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>responded</a></strong> to her comments in 2022, saying: "I think it’s unfair to make those kind of blanket statements because we have kids now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/04162fb2c9b9-kardashian-jenner-family-tree-3.jpg><p id=egILyrnkngTP data-wc=67>"I think she should be more responsible about those statements," he continued, adding: "Because it happened in the past, you can try to sweep it under the rug, but you don’t stay married to somebody or be with somebody for four to five years and it’s just based off you getting high off of ecstasy, you know what I mean? That doesn’t make any sense at all."</p><p id=eC9nd6E30QZ0 data-wc=8><strong>SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson's relationship timeline</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=evJ7CurLjCo3 data-wc=54>Kim and Damon split after three years of marriage and finalized their divorce in 2004. Again on her reality TV show, Kim suggested one of the reasons for their split was she grew to dislike how controlling Damon was in their relationship. Damon has always denied Kim's claims that he was abusive towards her.</p><h2><strong>Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries' wedding</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fd49aeb97e28-kim-kardashian-three-weddings-kris-humphries.jpg><p id=e9OGr82a74Ca data-wc=57>Kim Kardashian married basketball player Kris Humphries in Montecito, California in 2011. The couple began dating in 2010, and got engaged in 2011. In August that same year, the two tied the knot in <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a lavish $10million wedding</a></strong> which was heavily publicized due to it featuring as a big event in the Kardashians' ongoing reality TV series.</p><p id=eMQgw5c9TyVo data-wc=32>In October 2011 the two-part special aired, showing how the couple had wed in front of 440 guests. Among them were <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Demi Lovato</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Mario Lopez</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Eva Longoria</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Avril Lavigne</a></strong> and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/cd751a677faa-kim-kardashian-three-weddings-kris-birthday.jpg><p id=eCoocn0mml0 data-wc=49>Kim's ivory Vera Wang gown had a tulle skirt, basque waist and Chantilly lace, and was matched with a pair of Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. Meanwhile, Kris wore a white peak lapel tuxedo jacket, black tuxedo trousers, a white shirt and a white bow tie, all designed by Ermenegildo Zegna.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Travel back in time to see Kim's style evolution</figure><p id=eXwHrAbaEWU4 data-wc=81>The reality TV star's sisters and TV co-stars Kourtney and Khloe <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>served as maids of honour</a></strong> to Kim, who changed into two other Vera Wang looks over the course of the celebrations. But despite the long-lasting nature of Kim and Kris' well documented wedding, their relationship was not to be. After <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>just 72 days of marriage</a></strong> (and in the same month which their marriage special aired), Kim filed for divorce from her second husband. The arrangement was finalised in June 2013.</p><p id=eGomwlF4yx4H data-wc=95>During an appearance on <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a></strong>, Kim revealed the inner turmoil which had led to her ill-fated marriage to Kris. "At the time I just thought… I’m 30 years old — I better get this together,” she said. “[I thought] I better get married. I think a lot of girls do go through that, where they freak out thinking they’re getting old and all their friends are having kids. So, it was more of that situation. But I knew on the honeymoon it wasn’t going to work out," she revealed.</p><h2><strong>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding</strong></h2><p id=eMSs28_sP9Xc data-wc=52>Kim and Kanye first met in 2003, but it was only in 2012 that the couple started dating. The musician, who also goes by the name 'Ye' and A-list reality TV star got engaged in October 2013 following the birth of their first child, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>North West</a></strong>, in June of the same year.</p><p id=eONLMp51f3qz data-wc=46>The famous pairing got married in May 2014 during <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a private ceremony</a></strong> which occurred at Fort di Belvedere in Florence. Kim and Kanye's guests were also told the wedding would be <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>taking place in Paris</a></strong>, but on arrival were then flown to the Italian location instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/f9d0e26ffbd9-kim-kardashian-wedding-dress-a.jpg><p id=eCunoq3EqwlG data-wc=35>Kim looked beautiful in a <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>bespoke couture wedding dress</a></strong> designed by Riccardo Tisci, formerly creative director of Givenchy, as she said 'I do' at the 16th-century location. The couple's marriage celebrations lasted a whole weekend.</p><p id=ev48pNY5v2Xs data-wc=69>The evening before their nuptials, Kim and Kanye hosted a rehearsal dinner for around 600 guests in the Palace of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors. This along with this spectacular celebration, the couple's wedding weekend reportedly cost the couple <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a whopping $7.5million</a>&nbsp;</strong>in total. Among Kim and Kanye's 600 guests were members of the Kardashian clan, including Kim's mother <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kris Jenner&nbsp;</a></strong>and the bride's sisters <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kourtney</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Khloé</a></strong>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kendall</a></strong> and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kylie</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/58a88ba152e7-kim-kanye-courtside-z.jpg><p id=eYLKZxqTc7a0 data-wc=71>The ceremony was largely kept out of view by a towering wall of white flowers to give Kim and Kanye the privacy they had wanted on their big day, a huge contrast to the star's previous marriage to Kris in 2011. The private venue was also decorated with an abundance of floral arrangements from Fiori Della Signoria, one of Florence's oldest flower shops, which <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a></strong> estimated to have been worth $136,000<strong>.</strong></p><p id=eDOjZI2R_fQ6 data-wc=66>Kim and Kanye went on to have three more children, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Saint</a>&nbsp;</strong>(born in 2015), <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Chicago</a></strong> (born in 2018 via a surrogate) and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Psalm</a></strong> (born in 2019, also through a surrogate). The pair <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>renewed their marriage vows</a></strong> in 2019, however as has been widely publicized over the last few years, Kim <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>filed for divorce</a></strong> for the third time in February 2021.
