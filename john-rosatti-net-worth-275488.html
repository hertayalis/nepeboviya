Born in 1944 in Brooklyn, New York, John Rosatti is a true personification of the American Dream as he has risen from humble beginnings to vast riches. Raised with his Italian family's belief in working as hard as you can to earn your living, Rosatti was only 13 when he entered the workforce to help his family. He was mainly assisting his father who worked on boats, thus he acquired initial mechanical skills that he later used to venture into the automobile industry.</p><p>By the early 60's, Rosatti was already working with various car-related companies, making connections and working on tasks like demolition and moving cars across long distances. This experience made him confident enough to set up a body shop in 1968. Less than a decade later, in 1976, Rosatti purchased a Honda Motorcycle and Oldsmobile factory. Eventually, John Rosatti would open the doors of Brooklyn's Plaza Auto Mall, which has grown to encompass 16 leading automotive brands. It was the unprecedented success of his Plaza Auto Mall that made him awarded as a top auto dealer in the nation for several of his brands. Then the dealership started expanding its holdings far outside the borders of the New York City and Long Island markets, including Long Island, Nevada, New Jersey and Florida.</p><p>Most recently, he switched his interest in the culinary world, launching several high-end, Zagat-rated restaurants in the South Florida area, like Vic & Angelo's and The Office Delray. But apart from these award-winning full-service restaurants, Rosatti also created a restaurant franchise concept, BurgerFi, that has become the fastest-growing all-natural burger franchise in the country, being poised to open 150 stores nationwide. Thanks to BurgerFi's incredible growth, the media labeled the expansion as the "BurgerFication of the Nation". A successful businessman as he is, John Rosatti enjoys life filled with luxury yachts, cars, and planes. But he still has managed to put aside some of his time and wealth for charitable causes like The American Heart Association, the Boys and Girls Club of Broward County and the G&P Foundation for Cancer Research. Furthermore, he is a proud father of three children and currently resides in Palm Beach County, Florida with his longtime girlfriend, Dawn Kimball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeapLWvedGoqpqspJ56r7HTZq6oqqSdenODlG1vcQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-rosatti-net-worth-275488.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-rosatti-net-worth-275488.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-rosatti-net-worth-275488.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-rosatti-net-worth-275488.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-rosatti-net-worth-275488.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-rosatti-net-worth-275488.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./144161-rihannas-work-lyrics-have-a-double-meaning-that-you-dont-want-to-miss.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./144161-rihannas-work-lyrics-have-a-double-meaning-that-you-dont-want-to-miss.html>Rihanna's &amp;quot;Work&amp;quot; Lyrics Have A Double Meaning That You Don't Want To Miss</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cindy-crawford.html>House of Style Host, Cindy Crawford Completed Her 21st Marriage Anniversary With Rande Gerber!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cindy-crawford.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
