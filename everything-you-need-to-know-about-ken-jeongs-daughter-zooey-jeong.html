She gained notoriety for her roles in the Laura Marano: Boombox music video and the comic television show Dr. Ken.</strong></p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>Young enough to not be working is Zooey. But in Dr. Ken, she did make a brief cameo. Zooey appreciates humor as well; perhaps someday she’ll emulate her father.</p><p>She receives income from both of her parents. Tran Ho, her mother, is not specifically acknowledged despite earning a respectable income. On the other hand, her father has established a name for himself as an actor.</p><h2><span id=Parents_of_Zooey_Jeong>Parents of Zooey Jeong</span></h2><p>Ken Jeong (the father) and Tran Ho gave birth to Zooey Jeong (the mother). Ken is a qualified physician from the United States who also works as an actor, comedian, producer, writer, and television host. He was born in Detroit, Michigan, USA, on July 13, 1969.</p><p>Zooey was born and raised by South Korean immigrants in northern California. He was conceived by North Carolina A&T State University economics professor D.K. Jeong.</p><p>His most well-known roles include those in Knocked Up (2007), Role Models (2008), Furry Vengeance (2010), Ride Along 2 (2016), Crazy Rich Asians (2018), The Hangover film series (2009-2013), and Community (2009-2015).</p><p>In the ABC sitcom Dr. Ken, he again played the role of Dr. Ken (2015–2017). He has a medical license and abandoned his practice to pursue acting.</p><p>He was convinced to give up his medical job and pursue acting by his wife. Zooey’s mother, Tran ho, is a family doctor who is of Vietnamese descent.</p><p>She was born on February 24, 1972, in the US. In 2008, Tran discovered lumps on her breast while nursing her children and received a breast cancer diagnosis when her daughter was just a year old. Stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer was discovered in her.</p><p>Contrarily, Tran fought valiantly and overcame cancer, becoming a survivor and cancer-free person in 2009. When she was battling cancer, her spouse helped her.</p><p>He was taking care of their kids and getting Tran to the hospital and making sure she was well. Zooey Jeong’s twin sister is Alexa Jeong. The two sisters get along well and are very close.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Tran_Ho_And_Ken_Jeong_Meet>How Did Tran Ho And Ken Jeong Meet?</span></h2><p>When Ken and Tran were both employed at Kaiser Permanente Hospital, they first met. At the hospital, they both had jobs. Gradually, their connection grew, and they started dating.</p><p>After some time together, they made the decision to be married in order to advance their relationship. They were married in September 2004, however, it is unknown where they exchanged vows. Together with his wife and two kids, Ken currently makes his home in Calabasas, California.</p><h2><span id=Jimmy_offered_his_congratulations_to_Zooey_Jeong8217s_father>Jimmy offered his congratulations to Zooey Jeong’s father</span></h2><p>Jimmy congratulated Zooey Jeong’s father, Ken Jeong, on the achievement of his movie “Crazy Rich Asians,” which brought in over $240 million at the box office. It made $242.89 million worldwide and $174 million domestically, but it doesn’t matter, Ken sarcastically remarked.</p><p>When Jimmy asked Ken why he wouldn’t be in the movie, Ken responded that due to his schedule and other projects that may or may not have succeeded, the end of his show “Dr. Ken” allowed him to concentrate on the movie. It is one of the most fulfilling projects he has ever worked on, he continued.</p><p>Then they talked about “The Masked Singer.” When the chance to participate as a panelist was provided to Ken, his mother insisted that he do the show because it was the number one program in Korea and she was a huge fan.</p><p>Jimmy was surprised to hear that his wife came up with the idea for the title of his Netflix stand-up special, “You Complete Me Ho,” and he enjoyed performing in it.</p><p>Ken claims it’s a love letter to his wife, and the Pasadena club “The Ice House,” where he played and where his wife first saw him perform, served as the inspiration for the song’s title, “The First Date.”</p><h2><span id=Zooey_and_Alexa_Ken8217s_twins_form_a_strong_bond>Zooey and Alexa, Ken’s twins, form a strong bond</span></h2><p>Zooey and Alexa, Ken’s twin kids, have a special bond. Ken wrote an open letter to his kids on Father’s Day. He talked to them about the qualities he finds most admirable in them and his preferred time of day.</p><p>The two most precious gifts Ken had ever gotten in his life were his wife and them. In an interview with “Life of Dad,” Ken stated that his twins enjoy watching “Community.”</p><p>Even though he is quite particular about which episodes they can watch. Even if it’s not his humor, he loves that people enjoy the show’s wit.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
