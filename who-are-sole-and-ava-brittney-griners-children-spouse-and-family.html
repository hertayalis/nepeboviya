Ava and Sole Griner, twin children of American basketball player Brittney Griner, are a blessing.</p><p>She does indeed refer to herself as their father.</p><p>Griner is pleased to be the mother to Ava and Solei, her two identical twins. Griner and her ex-wife Glory Johnson, who were in a relationship before, announced that they were expecting twins.</p><p>Ava and Solei Johnson and Griner’s twin children were born on October 12, 2015, at the gestational age of 16 weeks.</p><p>But the former couple’s union came to a bitter end.

She received a fine of more than $16,000 (one million rubles) from the responsible authorities.</p><h2><span id=Meet_Cherelle_Griner_and_Glory_Johnson_the_wives_of_Brittney_Griner>Meet Cherelle Griner and Glory Johnson, the wives of Brittney Griner</span></h2><p>Brittney Griner, a basketball player with the Phoenix Mercury, wed Glory Johnson on May 8, 2015.</p><p>But after several arguments and conflicts, their romance was rejected and terminated bitterly. On April 22, 2015, an argument between the two prompted the police to call their home.</p><p>Police detained them due to their disruptive behavior and attacks. Both Griner and Glory suffered a few wounds.</p><p>They chose to have children despite their argument, and on June 4, 2015, they revealed they were expecting twins.</p><p>In August 2018, Griner also made a marriage proposal to Cherelle Watson, his second wife. In June 2019, Watson and Griner exchanged vows.</p><p>Cherelle honored her lesbian husband, Brittney, by changing her last name from Watson to Griner.</p><p>Cherelle Griner, Brittney’s wife, had worked as a teacher.
