Anyone following Colman’s career these days, however, can tell he’s on his way to earning double, maybe triple that amount very soon.</p><p>After giving several captivating performances in 2023, including The Color Purple and as the late openly gay activist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayard Rustin</a>, Colman quickly launched into A-list status. In January 2024, days after he received his Oscar nod for Rustin, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Out Magazine</a> dubbed him “Hollywood’s first Black gay movie star.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Out Magazine (@outmagazine)</a></p></figure><p>In Colman’s cover story for the magazine, he said that, while all of his characters don’t reflect all of his identities, he intentionally brings a little of each intersectionality into his characters.</p><p>“It wasn’t even designed that way,” Colman told the outlet of using his identity in his characters. “Though it is something I’ve just been trying to do my entire career, I need you to see me the way I see myself. I need you to see me without limitation. I want you to see me as an artist, as a thinker, as a creator.”</p><p>“In the middle [of both of these characters] is me who’s just constantly trying to explore Black men and how we operate, how we love, whether there’s redemption or not,” he continued. “There’s a human quality that I’m trying to explore in all these different kinds of people, whether they’re a pimp or a bandleader. I always want to be useful [to the narrative or story], and then let’s see how I can tell my story [through it].”</p><p class="sc-ljslrt jczKas"><span>Colman Domingo</span></p><p class="sc-htmbXw iarkkR">Actor, Writer, Director</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $2 million</p><p>Colman Domingo is an actor, writer, and director known for his roles as Victor in Fear The Walking Dead, Ali in Euphoria, Albert “Mister” in The Color Purple, and for his Oscar-nominated role as Bayard Rustin in Rustin.

Before he would go on to win an Emmy for his role as <a href=#>Ali in Euphoria</a>, Colman said he nearly quit acting in 2014.</p><p>The actor explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> that he was forced to rethink his career after losing a role he felt would be his big break. He said he auditioned to play a maitre’d in HBO’s <a href=#>Boardwalk Empire</a> but didn’t get selected because of his skin color.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After auditioning for the role, Colman said his agent told him that a researcher on the project said he didn’t fit the profile of a maitre’d because he wasn’t light-skinned.</p><p>"That's when I lost my mind," Colman recalled of the rejection, telling his agent, “I can't take it anymore. I think this is going to kill me."</p><p>Despite his initial yearning to quit acting, Colman kept going and, almost a decade later, blossomed into the star he was always meant to be. And now, with his growing fortune, he has enough to continue slaying every red carpet he will surely grace!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLytucCnZJ2nnZ67qLuMp5ytZaekv7W0</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcolman-domingo-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcolman-domingo-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcolman-domingo-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcolman-domingo-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcolman-domingo-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcolman-domingo-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yohanny-montesquieu-net-worth-193698.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yohanny-montesquieu-net-worth-193698.html>Yohanny Montesquieu Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./royals-celebrate-princess-kate-middleton-41-birthday-prince-harry-memoir.html>Royals Celebrate Kate Middleton's Birthday amid Prince Harry Memoir Drama</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./royals-celebrate-princess-kate-middleton-41-birthday-prince-harry-memoir.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
