And in 1987, already a millionaire, the martial arts expert was ready to take America by storm with what turned out to be his breakthrough film in the West, "After a few similar movies, the US audience will begin to know me," he predicted. "Then it will be Jackie, Jackie, Jackie all the way." And the star born Chan Kwong Sang in Hong Kong on April 7, 1954, was right.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Childhood</strong></h2><p id=eEd-HEY0l-j data-wc=71>The path to global stardom proved a long one for the former stuntman. His mum and dad weren't very well off, however, eventually got back on their feet after finding jobs cooking and cleaning at the French consulate. "I actually have the French government to thank for my present-day physique," Jackie once said. "My father, as head cook, would always save the best cut of steak for me, his only child."&nbsp;</p><p id=eCmBqwIWpU data-wc=60>Aged six, Jackie moved with his family to the Australian capital of Canberra to work for the US consulate, but Chan Junior was soon sent back to Hong Kong to study at the Chinese Opera Research Institute. There, he faced gruelling days which started at 5am and ended at midnight, while undergoing rigorous training in singing, martial arts and acrobatics.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p id=edlAuhMze- data-wc=214>By the late Sixties, after a visiting filmmaker offered him a job as a stunt man in a Chinese action film, Jackie was taking on largely uncredited roles in films such as Bruce Lee's and After Lee's sudden death in 1973, one of his former directors, Lo Wei, cast Jackie in several films, aiming to promote him as the next incarnation of the icon. Jackie, however, had other ideas. "I wanted to be like Chaplin or Buster Keaton, but all the martial arts directors wanted me to copy Bruce Lee. So after I got famous I started to change a lot of things... I decided, when Bruce Lee kicked high, I'd kick low. When Bruce Lee yowled, I'd punch doing a funny face like it hurt. Whatever Bruce Lee did, I'd do the opposite. "This blend of slapstick and action and the fact he performed all his own stunts helped him strike box office gold with his breakthrough hit in 1977. After briefly working Stateside in 1980 (he had a bit part in Burt Reynolds' road comedy ), Jackie spent the Eighties mining his winning streak in Asia, where his big-budget stints as both actor and director earned him the title "a local Steven Spielberg".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a1e16cb59e1f-gettyimages-622942456.jpg><h2>Personal Life</h2><p id=elBXQcMBiuW data-wc=117>Many a female heart was broken when he married Taiwanese actress Len Feng-Chiao in 1983. The couple, who were briefly estranged in 1998 after Jackie had a child with former Miss Asia, Elaine Ng, has one son, aspiring singer Chan Cho-ming, also known as JC. Jackie's risky on-set stunt work which is featured in outtakes at the end of his films has not been without consequences. He is said to have broken nearly every bone in his body at one time or another and permanently lodged a piece of skull in his brain after a 45-foot fall in Yugoslavia while filming an accident which also caused him to lose some hearing in one ear.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUl1v3wfUx8 data-wc=81>In his late 40s, Jackie admits he may be slowing down - but he's definitely not stopping. "Fights and stunts take me longer to do, but I have no choice," he says. "My life is the movies." &nbsp;Away from the big screen, Jackie has been involved in a number of admirable philanthropic pursuits. He is a UNICEF GoodWill Ambassador, and he has campaigned against animal abuse and pollution as well as assisting with relief efforts for the 2004 Ocean Tsunami victims.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9qcGNkt6KvyqKcZpuYlrtw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20091008183.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f20091008183.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f20091008183.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f20091008183.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20091008183.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20091008183.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./my-favorite-nail-polish-for-ap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./my-favorite-nail-polish-for-ap.html>My Favorite Nail Polish For April 2012</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-gavin-guidry-related-to-ron-guidry-parents.html>Is Gavin Guidry Related To Ron Guidry?
